# phixiv

[pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/) embed fixer. If you run into any issues or have any suggestions to make this service better, please [make an issue](https://github.com/HazelTheWitch/phixiv/issues/new).

## How to use

Simply replace "pixiv" with "phixiv" in the url to embed properly on Discord, etc. Alternatively, if on discord simply paste the pixiv url and send `s/i/p` after, this will edit the previous message, replacing `pixiv` with `ppxiv` which will also embed properly; please note this will require the link to include the first `i` in your message.

## Limitations

Due to the nature of pixiv, R-18 works can not be displayed through the embed. In cases where it is attempted the embed should fall back to the default pixiv embed.
