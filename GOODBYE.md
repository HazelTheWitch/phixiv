# Regarding Phixiv

I will be discontinuing service to phixiv on January 1, 2024.

This project has become a bit too much for me, the hosting costs are too much to justify for a side project.
It has stopped being a fun programming project and has turned into a nightmare of managing infrastructure and comparing hosting platforms.
The code hosted here will remain available to anyone who wishes to expand on it or host it themselves.

The main cost of hosting is egress traffic, since pixiv requires I proxy the images phixiv is transfering roughly 20-30 gb of data a day, which at $0.10/GB
is $75 a month.

If you are interested in picking up hosting please contact me via Discord at `harlot` or just make an issue in this repo, you'll probably need help getting it running
properly, a couple environment variables to set.
I will gladly change DNS records and eventually transfer the domains over if that is desired.
Currently the registration expires in December 2024.

I am grateful for everyone who has used this service in the last year and I hope someone else creates a similar project. I hope it was useful.
